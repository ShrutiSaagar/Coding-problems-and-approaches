# Leetcode - 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue
[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/) - [My Leetcode soln](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/discuss/1429997/Java-DP-No-stack-different-solution-strategy-98ile)

Wanted to share a different thinking process that does not use stack and uses the information stored on the elements towards the current elements right.

**Idea:**
This solution involves the idea that the we can reach the element that is greater than or equal to current element by jumping on to the element pointed to by the right elements which are smaller than current. For this purpose we use the idx array to store the pointing index of each element.

I know now in retrospect after coding this solution and comparing the stack solution that the fundamental idea is similar but yeah this thought came to me first before the stack solution. So at least it can be thought of as a different way of visualizing usage of a stack.
DP solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] canSeePersonsCount(int[] heights) {
        int n= heights.length;
        int[] dp  = new int[n];
        int[] idx = new int[n];
        dp[n-1]=0; // no one to its right
        idx[n-1]=n; // points to a an element outside array
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(heights[i]>heights[i+1]){
                int co=1,j=i+1, max_ht=0;
                while(j<n-1 && heights[j]<heights[i] && heights[j]> max_ht){
                    co++;
                    max_ht = Math.max(max_ht, heights[j]);
                    j=idx[j];
                }
                dp[i]=co;
                if(j==n ||(j==n-1 && heights[j]<max_ht)) { // Much easily understandable when we compare it with stack solutions's equivalent where after removing all lesser elements if stack is not empty we increase answer, in this case we need to decrease as it has already been taken into account
                    idx[i] = n;
                    dp[i]--;
                } else
                    idx[i]=j;
            }
            else {
                dp[i] = 1;
                idx[i] = i+1;
            }
        }
        return dp;
    }
}
