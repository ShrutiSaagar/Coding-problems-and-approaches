# Leetcode - 932. Beautiful Array
[Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-array/) - [My Leetcode soln](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-array/discuss/1430076/Java-nlog(n)-0ms-Different-recursive-solution-thinking)


**Idea / Intuition**
* The strategy that I found was that any 3 of the elements which are same distance apart in the same sequence would cause the array to not be beautiful.
* That is 1,2,3 are not beautiful and also 1,3,5 . But I realized that if I split the array as odds and evens then between the two subarrays if we pick one from each the beautiful condition was satisfied (ofcourse because even + odd divided by 2 will not be an integer :) ). 
* Still within each half it was not beautiful. Then I thought for each half as well, if we did the same but not thinking of odds and evens as numbers but indices then it would make the new smaller quarters beautiful. Because the equidistant 3 numbers need to be shuffled, so **we pick alternatively and group them together.**

**Example:**
[1,2,3,4,5,6]    -> [1,3,5] & [2,4,6] **(beautiful condition satisfied for any i from first half and j from second half)**
[1,3,5] & [2,4,6]  -> [1,5] & [3] & [2,6] & [4] **(now (1+3)/2 was not 5 and same for (2+4)/2)**

So I inferred that if we did it recursively till we reach individual elements we would have a beautiful array. So here is my solution below:
Time Complexity - O(Nlog(N))
Space Complexity - O(N)
**Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] beautifulArray(int n) {
        int[] res= new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            res[i]=i+1;
        recur(0,n-1,res);
        return res;
    }
    
    void recur(int i, int j, int[] res){
        if(j-i<2) return;
        int even=(j-i+1)/2;
        int odd=even;
        if ((j-i+1)%2==1) odd++;
        int[] odarr= new int[odd];
        int[] evarr= new int[even];
        int ic=i,jc=j,vi=0;
        while(ic<=jc){
            odarr[vi]=res[ic];
            if(ic+1<=jc) evarr[vi]=res[ic+1];
            ic+=2;vi++;
        }
        for(int x=0;x<odd;x++)
            res[i+x]=odarr[x];
        for(int x=0;x<even;x++)
            res[i+odd+x]=evarr[x];
        recur(i, i+odd-1, res);
        recur(i+odd, j, res);
        return;
    }
}
```
